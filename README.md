# Fungus2FountainExp
A tool that converts stories written in Fungus the Unity tool to Fountain Exponential.

Fountain Exponential and Fungus not very similar. Fungus is a much broader tool then Fountain Exponential and is tightly integrated with Unity. Fountain Exponential focuses on being an independant standard for the story of a game. However Fungus has a conversation mode simular to dialog in Fountain exponential that may be extracted and converted to a story  in Fountain Exponential.
